# Fonts

Naco UI components are designed to work seamlessly across various platforms. To maintain a consistent and pleasing appearance for your users, follow these recommendations for fonts on different platforms:

## macOS (Apple)

### Recommended Font: San Francisco

When developing for macOS, the San Francisco font is the primary choice. It's Apple's default system font. However, please note that we can't provide San Francisco as part of the Naco UI library due to licensing restrictions set by Apple.

### Fallback Font: Inter

In cases where San Francisco isn't available, we use the Inter font as a fallback in the Naco UI library. You can integrate Inter through Google Fonts as a replacement when San Francisco is unavailable.

## Ubuntu (Linux)

### Recommended Font: Ubuntu

On Ubuntu and similar Linux distributions, the default system font is Ubuntu. It's a freely available font.

## Ensuring Font Compatibility

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a consistent and visually appealing user experience on both macOS and Ubuntu/Linux platforms. Always respect font licensing terms and ensure you have the necessary rights to use them in your project.
