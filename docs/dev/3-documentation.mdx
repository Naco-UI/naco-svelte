# Writing Documentation

Use the following formats for your documentation:

- `*.stories.svelte` — description of stories of interaction with the component;
- `*.docs.mdx` — component documentation based on stories.

## Style

- Stay calm, be polite, and show respect;
- Avoid using complicated words or inside jokes;
- Make statements instead of saying what not to do;
- The imperative mood (do something, run a command, etc.).

## Text in documentation and examples

- Make your text and examples easy to understand;
- Divide the text into smaller parts that are easy to digest;
- If you want to be funny, use jokes only in the examples, not in the main text. Make sure the jokes don't confuse the reader.

## Formatting

- Use bold or special text for important words;
- Make lists for information with lots of items;
- If you talk about something else, tell where to find it;
- Use headings no higher than level 3 (`#`, `##` and `###`).

## Component documentation template

To simplify writing component documentation, use the following template:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```markdown
import { Intro, Meta, Props, Story } from '$storybook/docs'
import * as Stories from './ComponentName.stories.svelte'

<Meta of={Stories} />

<Intro
  name="ComponentName"
  description="Component brief description."
/>

<!-- Basic story -->
<Story of={Stories.Basic} />

## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

## Example 1

<Story of={Stories.Example1} />

## Example 2

<Story of={Stories.Example2} />

## Example 3

<Story of={Stories.Example3} />

<!-- And so on -->
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}
