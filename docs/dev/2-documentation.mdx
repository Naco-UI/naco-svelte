# Writing Documentation

Use the following formats for your documentation:

- \*.stories.svelte — description of stories of interaction with the component;
- \*.docs.mdx — component documentation based on stories.

```markdown
import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs'
import { Intro, Props } from '../../../../.storybook/components'
import \* as Stories from './Component.stories';

<Meta of={Stories} />

<Intro
  name="Component name"
  description="Component brief description."
/>

<!-- Basic story -->
<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Basic} />
</Canvas>

## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

## Example 1

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Example1} />
</Canvas>

## Example 2

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Example2} />
</Canvas>

## Example 3

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Example3} />
</Canvas>

<!-- And so on -->
```

## Style

- Calm, neutral and respectful;
- Free of jargons and local memes;
- Assertion, not negation;
- The imperative mood (do something, run a command, etc.).

## Text in documentation and examples

- Try to come up with clear and accessible text and examples;
- Break the text into easily digestible parts;
- Use humor where appropriate and only in the examples, not in the text. Jokes should not distract the user from the context of what is happening.

## Formatting

- Use formatting to highlight important definitions and terms in your documentation;
- Use lists to list objects of information;
- If another component or functionality is mentioned in the text, make it a reference.
- Use headings no higher than level 3 (`#`, `##` and `###`)
