# Commit Message Convention

The [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with [SemVer](https://semver.org/), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit type

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of Naco UI:

- **feat**: new functionality, increases minor in the package version if BREAKING CHANGE is not specified;
- **fix**: bug fixes, raises patch for package version if BREAKING CHANGE is not specified;
- **refactor**: code changes without fixing bugs or adding functionality.
- **docs**: documentation changes;
- **test**: adding or editing tests;
- **style**: changes in code appearance, formatting (tabs, indents, periods, commas, etc.);
- **chore**: adding, updating or customizing tools and libraries;
- **build**: project building or external dependencies change;
- **perf**: performance improvement;
- **revert**: undoing of changes.

## Scope

Allows you to specify in which area of the repository the change occurred (optional). In a component library, scopes are component names: Button, Stack, etc.

## Subject

Allows you to briefly specify the action done in this commit. Start the description with a verb in the imperative mood.

## Body

Allows you to specify a description that cannot fit in the title (optional).

## Footer

The footer should be used to indicate external links, commit context or other meta information (optional). The footer should be separated from the body by a blank line.

## BREAKING CHANGE

Description of changes that break backward compatibility. Breaking change can occur in commits of any type. `BREAKING CHANGE` is specified in the message body.

## Example

```
feat(Button): Add `warning` color
```
