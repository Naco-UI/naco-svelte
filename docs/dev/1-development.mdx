# Start Development

Before you can start developing, you need to install dependencies. Naco uses the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager.

<Source language="bash" code="pnpm install --frozen-lockfile" />

It is highly recommended to install git hooks in the project repository. They make it easier to follow [Code Style](/?path=/docs/documentation-development-code-style--docs). To install them, run the command:

<Source language="bash" code="pnpm hook" />

To start Storybook in development mode, run the command:

<Source language="bash" code="pnpm dev" />

To start server with production Storybook build, run:

<Source language="bash" code="pnpm preview" />
