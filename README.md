# Svelte Naco UI [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@naco-ui/svelte)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@naco-ui/svelte)

Svelte component library for creating interfaces with web technologies that feels native.

## Motivation

Creating desktop applications using web technologies is great. But the sad thing is that such applications are very different from the environment in which they work.

After [Wails](https://wails.io/) was released, I started making such applications too (because there's Go and ~8 mb of binary). The question was: what to do with the appearance? Should I use Material UI or another popular library? Then the app will look like an alien everywhere.

So I started to make this component library. Its tasks:

- To mimic native components as much as possible;
- Make it easy to create cross-platform interfaces.

## Quick start

Information needed to use the library:
