## Properties

## Hide Sidebar

Sometimes in an app with a sidebar, it needs to be hidden. To do this, set the `hideSidebar` property. A short time after hiding, the sidebar components will be unloaded from the DOM, to optimize performance. If this behavior is not suitable for you, set the `keepDOM` property and the components will always remain.

  <Story of={Stories.HideSidebar} />

## Transparent

On macOS, it supports transparent mode. In this mode, the background behind the sidebar becomes completely transparent. Use this mode with the right background. See [WindowIsTranslucent](https://wails.io/docs/reference/options#windowistranslucent-1) in Wails.
