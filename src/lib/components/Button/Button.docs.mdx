## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

- The button text should start with a capital letter, do not use <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>;
- The text of the button must fit completely into the button container
- Almost always, a verb that answers the question "What to do?" is appropriate for the button text. For example: Find, Save, Accept, etc;
- Specify the text of the button as precisely as possible;
- Keep the button text as short as possible. Limit yourself to a maximum of 3 words for the button text;

## Primary

Button can be primary or secondary (default). To make the button primary, add the `primary` property.

## Variant

Button is available in two versions:

- `alert` - for simple modal windows
- `default` - for everything else.

## Color

Use the `color` property to change the color of the button.

## Disabled state

The `disabled` property locks the button - it is no longer possible to press it. In addition, such a button cannot get focus by pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, by mouse or in any other way.

## Hotkey

The `click` event call can be optionally attached to hotkey. To do this, set the hotkey template to the `hotkey` property
