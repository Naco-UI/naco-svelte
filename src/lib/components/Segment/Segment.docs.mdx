## Properties

<Props />

## When to use

- When you want the user to select only one option;
- When you need to switch tabs (macOS).

## Disabled

The `disabled` property locks the segment control - it is no longer possible to press it. In addition, such a control cannot get focus by pressing the Tab key, by mouse or in any other way.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Disabled} />
</Canvas>

## Controlled disabled

The disabled state of each item can be set separately. To do this, set `disabled: true` in the option parameters.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.ControlledDisabled} />
</Canvas>

## Title

The option header may differ from the value returned by the option. To do this, set the `title` property for the option.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Title} />
</Canvas>
