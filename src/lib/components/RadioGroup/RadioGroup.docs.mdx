## Properties

<Props />

## When to use

- When you want the user to select only one option;
- When you need to switch tabs (macOS).

## Direction

A group of radio buttons can be arranged both vertically and horizontally. To control this, set the `direction` property.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Direction} />
</Canvas>

## Value

To control the state of radio buttons (or to set default values), the `value` property is used. To bind it to a local variable, use `bind:value`.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Value} />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

To lock individual items, set `disabled: true` in the options. To block the entire group, set the `disabled` property on it.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Disabled} />
