## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

- Use a toggle for parameters with two values when changes take effect immediately;
- Use a toggle when the action does not require confirmation;
- Do not place too many toggles in a row. No more than 2-3, then a divider is required.

## Form (macOS)

The macOS forms use a special smaller version of the component. It is enabled automatically when the component is placed inside a [FormGroup](/?path=/docs/components-formgroup--docs).

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Form} />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

The `disabled` property locks the toggle - it is no longer possible to press it. In addition, such a toggle cannot get focus by pressing the Tab key, by mouse or in any other way.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Disabled} />
</Canvas>
