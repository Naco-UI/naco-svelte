## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

- Use a toggle for parameters with two values when changes take effect immediately;
- Use a toggle when the action does not require confirmation;
- Do not place too many toggles in a row. No more than 2-3, then a divider is required.

## Size

The macOS System Settings uses a small version of toggle, while GTK uses the standard version. That's why a small version of the switch is used for macOS. To make it large on macOS, set the `sizeMac="m"` parameter. This has no effect on the display for Linux.

  <Story of={Stories.Size} />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

The `disabled` property locks the toggle - it is no longer possible to press it. In addition, such a toggle cannot get focus by pressing the Tab key, by mouse or in any other way.
