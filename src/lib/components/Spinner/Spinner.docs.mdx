## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

- Use Spinner when the progress status cannot be determined or processing takes less than 5 seconds. If it takes longer, use ProgressBar;
- Do not use many spinners on one screen. It is better to combine several operations into one spinner.

## Size

The spinner can be presented in different sizes. The `size` property is responsible for that.
