## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

- Use Select when users are selecting only a single item from a set;
- And set is too long to show all available options at once.

## Borderless

The Linux and macOS settings interface uses a special variant of the component that has no background or stroke. If you are using Select inside a SettingsGroup, then add the `variant="borderless"` property.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Borderless} />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

To disable interaction with a component use the `disabled` property.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Disabled} />
</Canvas>
