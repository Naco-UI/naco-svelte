## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

- Use simple actions and clear titles;
- One heading can refer to 2-3 groups;
- Group related items together. This will make it easier for the user to understand.

## Multiple groups

When using more than one group, wrap them in `<Stack gap="m">`. A margin will be set correctly, given the presence of a titles.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.MultipleGroups} />
</Canvas>

## Multiple actions

One row can have multiple actions. To do this, simply pass multiple components to SettingsRow. But do not use too many, limit yourself to two.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.MultipleActions} />
</Canvas>

## Postfix

By passing the component into the `postfix` slot you can set the content to be displayed under the header and actions.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Postfix} />
</Canvas>
