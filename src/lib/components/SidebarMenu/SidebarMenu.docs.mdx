Use a SidebarMenu to help people quickly navigate to key areas of your app or top-level collections of content, like folders and playlists. A SidebarMenu can help you flatten your information hierarchy, giving people access to several peer information categories or modes at the same time.

## Usage recommendations

- When possible, let people customize the contents of a sidebar. A sidebar lets people navigate to important areas in your app, so it works well when people can decide which areas are most important and in what order they appear.
- In general, show no more than two levels of hierarchy in a sidebar. When a data hierarchy is deeper than two levels, consider using a split view interface that includes a content list between the sidebar items and detail view.
