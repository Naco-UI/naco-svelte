Radio buttons are similar to checkboxes, but with one important difference - radio buttons are intended for selecting one value from the offered ones, while checkboxes allow selecting several values.

Clicking on the name or on the radio button itself causes it to be selected. Clicking again does not deselect it.

## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

- One of the radio group values must be selected by default. Radio button does not suppose an empty state;
- Radio button is only used in a group and cannot consist of 1 item;
- If there are two options, you can arrange them in a row;
- If there are more than two options, you must arrange them in a column;
- If there are more than 5 or 6 options, use drop-down lists. They will save a lot of space in your interface.

## Disabled

The radio button can be locked via the `disabled` property.

## Group

The [RadioGroup](/?path=/docs/components-radiogroup--docs) component is used to group radio buttons. The `options` property accepts the same parameters as Radio

## Customization

The colors of the radio button can be overridden by setting CSS custom properties on the component:

- `--radio-custom-size` – Size of radio button;
- `--radio-custom-background` – Color, `url()` or gradient that will be the background of the radio button;
- `--radio-custom-border-color` – Radio button border color.
