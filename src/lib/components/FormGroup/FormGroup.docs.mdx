## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

- Use simple actions and clear titles;
- One heading can refer to 2-3 groups;
- Group related items together. This will make it easier for the user to understand.

## Raw layout

If you don't set the `title` property, the row will be displayed in "raw mode". You will be able to set its layout yourself.

<Story of={Stories.Raw} />

## Multiple groups

When using more than one group, wrap them in `<Stack gap="m">`. A margin will be set correctly, given the presence of a titles.

<Story of={Stories.MultipleGroups} />

## Multiple actions

One row can have multiple actions. To do this, simply pass multiple components to FormRow. But do not use too many, limit yourself to two.

<Story of={Stories.MultipleActions} />

## Subtitle

By passing string into the `subtitle` property you can set the content to be displayed under the header.

<Story of={Stories.Subtitle} />

## Align

If the subtitle is too long, it can ruin the look of the row by having the control creep off to an unexpected place. To fix this, set the `align="top"` property.

<Story of={Stories.Align} />
