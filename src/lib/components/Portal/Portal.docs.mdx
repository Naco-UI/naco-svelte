## Properties

<Props />

## Usage recommendations

- Use the portal if you need to display something outside the structure of the current component. For example, a modal window;
- Portals can be nested within each other. This way they are rendered outside the component structure, it won't cause any problems.

## Theme

By default, content within Portal is wrapped in <a href="/?path=/docs/components-themeprovider--docs">ThemeProvider</a>. If the `target` of the portal is set inside an existing ThemeProvider, add the `unwrapTheme` property to avoid unnecessary wrapping.
