import { Intro, Meta, Story } from '$storybook/docs'
import * as Stories from './hotkey.stories.svelte'

<Meta of={Stories} />

<Intro
  name="Hotkey"
  description="Useful functions for working with hotkeys."
  imports={['hotkey', 'onHotkey']}
/>

## Action

Action allows you to attach a hotkey to any element that handles an `on:click` event.

<Story of={Stories.Basic} />

## Button

[Button](/?path=/docs/components-button--docs) from the Naco UI has a `hotkey` property that works exactly the same way.

<Story of={Stories.NacoButton} />

## Hook

If something more complex than a button click is required, this can be solved with the `onHotkey` hook:

```ts
onHotkey('shift+alt+KeyR', (event) => {
  // KeyboardEvent event is passed to the callback.
  // preventDefault() is already called
  alert(event.target.name)
})
```
