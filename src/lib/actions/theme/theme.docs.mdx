<Intro
  name="Theme action"
  description="Internal action that is used to control design variables."

/>

A low-level action that is used to stylize all components included in Naco UI. The main task of the action is to collect a list of CSS custom properties depending on OS and theme, and set them on the selected HTML node.

<Story of={Stories.Basic} />

## Parameters

Action accepts an object with parameters.

- `os` – Operating system from the list of supported operating systems (`mac` or `linux`).
- `scheme` — Color scheme of the application. `dark` or `light`.
- `manifest` – Component theme manifest.
- `debug` — Optional debug mode flag. In this mode, all changes of variables will be logged in the console, and also additionally validation of consistency of values will be performed.

## Manifest

The theme manifest is an object. The only required key is the component prefix (usually the component name in lower case with dashes instead of spaces). So a minimal (but useless) manifesto looks like this:

```ts
const manifest: ThemeManifest = {
  prefix: 'my-component',
}
```

In order for the manifest to make sense, we need to add values to it. The values are divided into several logical parts (`common`, `mac` or `linux`). Within each part, a refinement of the theme, `light` or `dark`, is provided. Within the description, variables are divided into 3 logical sections: `color`, `size` and `effect`. Values in `color` and `effect` are substituted as they are, only cast to string. Values in `size` are converted to a string of the form `${value}px` if specified as a number.

For example, if you want the text to be white on macOS and black on Linux, the manifest would look like this:

```ts
const manifest: ThemeManifest = {
  prefix: 'my-component',
  common: {
    size: {
      padding: 4,
    },
  },
  mac: {
    color: {
      text: '#FFF',
    },
  },
  linux: {
    color: {
      text: '#000',
    },
  },
}
```

It is important that the list of variables ALWAYS be consistent. The set of variables should not change. If some values are not needed in some states, then set them to `null`, For example, if you want to add a separate shadow only in the dark theme on macOS, then the manifest would look like this:

```ts
const manifest: ThemeManifest = {
  prefix: 'my-component',
  common: {
    effect: {
      shadow: null, // Disable shadow by default
    },
  },
  mac: {
    dark: {
      effect: {
        shadow: '1px 0 0 3px #000', // Enable shadow for dark macOS
      },
    },
  },
}
```
