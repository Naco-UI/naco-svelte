## Parameters

Action accepts an object with parameters. The only required one is `lock`.

- `lock` – Lock indication. If set to `true`, scrolling is locked.
- `target` — `HTMLElement` or a string with a CSS selector. The element on which the lock will be placed. The default is `body`.
- `unlockDelay` – Parameter for synchronization with animation. Allows you to turn off scrolling after the end of the transition. Time in milliseconds. Default is 0.

## Target

Using the `target` property, you can lock scrolling in a particular container.
